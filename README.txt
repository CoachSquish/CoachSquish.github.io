Melody Map by Joe Torres, Colin Blum, and Harrison Yang

* For Cathacks IX, 2023 *

Purpose:
	This purpose of this website/algorithm is to create a personalized, music festival schedule for 
	the user based on the their preferred genre of music. The algorithm reads and sorts csv files that
	contain the artist lineups for Coachella 2023. It is separated by each day. When the user inputs their
	preferred genre, the algorithm sorts through the data to pick out artists playing each day and create
	a time based schedule.

	We wanted to implement this into a user friendly website that would display the schedule in an easily
	readable and aesthetic way. However, we were not able to get there. We used python to create the algorithm
	which was the first time any of us has ever used python so it was definitley a learning curve. The algorithm
	correctly sorts the data, however we were unable to integrate the python script into the HTML webpage.

	We also ran into the problem that the domain name we aquired from domain.com would not configure properly to 
	be attachable to the website.

	More information about our project will be included in our Devpost submission.
